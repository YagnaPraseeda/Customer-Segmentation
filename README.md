## Abstract:
The project focused on implementing data clustering techniques for e-commerce customer segmentation. The primary aim was to uncover meaningful patterns within the customer data, enabling targeted strategies for marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement. By employing customer-based clustering, geographical clustering, product-based clustering, and RFM clustering, the project successfully identified distinct customer segments, regional preferences, product groupings, and behavioral patterns. The Elbow Method aided in determining optimal cluster numbers. Stakeholders, including marketing teams, supply chain managers, expansion strategists, and customer support, can now leverage these insights for personalized campaigns, inventory optimization, targeted expansions, and enhanced customer retention. The project showcases the value of data-driven decision-making in tailoring business strategies to meet the diverse needs of e-commerce customers, ultimately fostering improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
